The Norwegian government has granted a permission to pump 2 million tons of toxic mining waste into the fjord annually.\n\nThis will impact the local fisheries that are essential to the Sea Sami culture and will be yet another attack on them from the norwegian state.\nThe mining company Nussir ASA has planned a mine in the mountain in the middle of reindeer guottetba\u0301iki (where the calves are born), which therefore is crucial for the reindeer.\n\nThere is currently an activist camp at Riehpovuotna and many people are resisting.\n\nEven though we must combat the climate crisis, this cannot be used as an excuse for so-called \u201cgreen\u201d colonialism with the same mindset that got us in this mess in the first place. #iifalnussir #reddrepparfjord #reddfjordene #savethefjords\nCred: @reddrepparfjord",

This used to be a forest, but after it was cut down forest companies have planted an invasive tree species that grows quicker than the local ones. Cutting down forests - at a time when we need to maximise every possible carbon sink - is not only disastrous for the climate, but also for biodiversity. Not to mention the local indigenous Sami reindeer herders who have lived here and cared for this land for thousands of years. When humans now change and destroy the landscape, they also completely alter the living conditions for the local wildlife, as well as for the reindeer and humans living there. It is not just the forests and carbon sinks that are being eliminated, but also the history, future and traditions of the Sami people.\nForests are not renewable, whatever the industries may say. Trees are renewable, but not forests. In a short term we only switch from one source of carbon to another when we burn biomass. Since we don\u2019t have the time it takes for the clear cut to compensate for the carbon debt (to stay below 1,5\u00b0C of global heating) it should not be considered \u201cclimate neutral\u201d.\nAmid the climate crisis and more frequent and intense extreme weather events (such as heatwaves, floods and wildfires) - these plantations also exacerbate their effects, increasing the devastation and suffering of people and wildlife.\nThe indigenous Sami people have been historically systematically oppressed, and still are so today. Indigenous peoples make up 5% of the world\u2019s population, but take care of 80% of the remaining healthy ecosystems. They are almost always on the frontline of the climate- and ecological crisis, but they are also leading the resistance. We have to listen to the guardians of the land and value their traditional knowledge to get out of this global crisis. The exploitation of nature, land and people needs to stop.\n#schoolstrike4climate\n#climatestrike\n#fridaysforfuture #IndigenousRights #StopFakeRenewables",
