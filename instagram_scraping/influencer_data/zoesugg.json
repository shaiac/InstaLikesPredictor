It\u2019s genuinely been an absolute pleasure to work with them over the years as I swear by the shampoo & conditioner and my shower is never without it! There are so many things I love about the custom formulations & honestly, my hair always feels so healthy & swish!\n\nIf you want to give it a try, are on the hunt for something new or you\u2019ve run out of your current bottles, go to functionofbeauty.com/zoesugg to get your limited edition bottles and free gift!

Feeling pretty good in myself overall & feeling her kick about in there is just my favourite thing in the world (even when she plays my ribs like a guitar with her little tootsies)\n\nHave also been feeling pretty overwhelmed the last few weeks. Thinking of all the things I want to get done before she\u2019s here, things we still need to buy, people I want to see before we have her, places I want to go\u2026 not that any of that really matters but my mind is really going into overdrive! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nI\u2019m just trying to get a few small things done a day so I\u2019m edging closer to feeling like I\u2019m prepared but I\u2019m starting to think even at 40 weeks you probably don\u2019t feel that prepared?\n\nOne thing I did make a start on today was a hospital bag list, so I\u2019d love to know what things were absolutely essential for you, for baby & for your partner or birthing companion so I don\u2019t miss anything off! \ud83e\udd70",

They are fresh, easy & taste delicious - and as a bonus, the pasta only takes 5 minutes to cook in the microwave and is always al dente! As an avid pasta eater, these have come at the perfect time (hello instant pregnancy hunger & new born on the way) and I can tell you, having tried ALL 4 of the kits, there isn\u2019t one I wouldn\u2019t eat over another, they are all great! How have you found working from home & has it affected your daily routine much? #lafamigliarana",
