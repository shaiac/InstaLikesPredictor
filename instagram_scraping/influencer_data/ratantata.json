In bringing today's, and perhaps tomorrow's technology to bear for the benefit of rural women is a great move forward. Over time, these efforts will ensure that the true value of the internet can come into the fore, with women at the forefront. I would like to congratulate @sundarpichai\nand teams at both @googleindia and @tata_trusts that have worked together to help make this happen.",

But what is more memorable, is the way Mumbai as a diverse people came together, casting aside all differences, to vanquish the terrorism and destruction on that day. Today, we certainly can mourn the ones we lost and honour the sacrifice of the brave who helped conquer the enemy, but what we must applaud, is the unity and the acts of kindness and sensitivity which we should cherish, and which hopefully, will continue to shine in the years ahead.",
