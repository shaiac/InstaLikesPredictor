Out of all my films, it was the perfect family with a perfect cast. Surekha Sikri was the head of our family, who was more progressive than the entire family tree. You know what, that was her in real life too. A complete boho. A chiller. Young at heart.\n\nI remember when she was boarding an auto rickshaw after the screening of our film, Tahira and I gave her a lift back home and we said \u201cma\u2019am you are the real star of our film\u201d and she replied \u201cwish I get more work.\u201d Tahira and I were speechless. We watched her frail demeanour walking towards her building. That\u2019s my last memory of her.\n\nI would request you to watch her recite Faiz Ahmed Faiz\u2019s nazm \u201cMujh-se pehli si mohabbat mere mehboob na maang.\u201d Aapko unse aur mohabbat ho jaayegi.\n\nAn impeccable performer. A consummate artiste. A legend. You\u2019ll be missed Surekha ma\u2019am. \ud83e\udd0d\n\nThank you for the beautiful memories.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n#RIPSurekhaSikri",
