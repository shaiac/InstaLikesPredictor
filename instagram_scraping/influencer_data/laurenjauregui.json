The people deserve resources and freedom of speech and protest. Food, medicine, access!! I also want to point out that the US Embargo doesn\u2019t help the situation in the slightest and that US intervention isn\u2019t going to be the savior to this situation. It\u2019s important to look at the situation with critical thought // Mi corazo\u0301n esta\u0301 con la gente de Cuba en este momento. La gente merecen libertad de la dictadura. La gente merecen el derecho de libertad de expresio\u0301n y protesta. Comida, medicina, acceso con\u0303o!! Tambie\u0301n quiero apuntar que el embargo de los Estados Unidos sobre Cuba no ayuda la situacio\u0301n y que la intervencio\u0301n de los Estados Unidos no es la solucio\u0301n que creen que es. Es importante observar lo que esta\u0301 pasando con una mente cri\u0301tica. \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddfaCUBA LIBRE!! #PatriayVida #SOSCuba mandando amor y fuerza\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddfa\n\nMy mother and my grandparents on both sides were born on the island. My fathers family in Havana and my mothers from Matanzas. I am very proud of the strong connection I have with my roots and my ancestors. They deserve to see through my eyes Cuba, finally, free\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddfa //\nMi mama\u0301 y mis abuelos por los dos lados nacieron en la isla. La familia de mi papa\u0301 en La Habana y la familia de mi madre en Matanzas. Siento much orgullo de tener una conexio\u0301n fuerte con mis raizes y ancestros. Merecen ver a trave\u0301s de mis ojos de donde esta\u0301n que Cuba, al fin, libre\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddfa\n\ud83d\udcf7: @efeamerica",

I feel deeply that when we women share our truths\u2014 with ourselves, one another, and especially together\u2014we heal. Thank you to all of the incredible women & folks who came together to create this visually and sonically\u2728 Im honored to be a part of your beautiful vision @heatherlowery . This song was one I wasn\u2019t sure the world was ever gonna hear. It\u2019s quite personal and was written from a vulnerable place of being completely tired of being told who the fuck I am and who I\u2019m supposed to be in order to be successful in this industry. It was written to someone, but at the end of it, like most of my songs, it was really just about me and making sure I was reminded of the power of my vulnerability and truth, no matter what anyone has to say about it in this judgmental ass world. I hope it empowers you to feel seen. #BigFemmeEnergy @FemmeItForward",

I don\u2019t know why but they\u2019ve always made me feel calm, even when the thunder was particularly upset. The sound of rain hitting the things we\u2019ve made, yes, while I sit at home or in a car seat and watch it through the window panes between us. It was one of the reasons I couldn\u2019t see myself living in California forever. It never rains. I need the rain. They tell us to stay out of it, that it ruins a sunny day but one thing about Miami is it\u2019s gonna have its aguaseros and it\u2019s descansos. Quince minutos si lo puedes soportar..and I prefer to wait it out in the water. On my birthday this year, the sun made a glorious appearance and kept me warm and the water refreshing..but the rain also stopped by to say hello and wish me a new year of life...offering me it\u2019s cleansing. Fresh meeting salt..floating in the vast expansiveness that is Yemaya\u2019s waters. It felt right. I feel most alive here. I feel held here..by the buoyancy of the water..by the spirits of my grandmothers and their mothers mothers. The water, in all its forms, reminds me we all belong to something greater and feeling it\u2019s caress will always feel like home.\n\n((tell me you\u2019re a water sign without telling me you\u2019re a water sign))",
