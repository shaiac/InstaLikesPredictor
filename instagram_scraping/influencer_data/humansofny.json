            "description": "Last night I caught Esther on FaceTime just as she was switching trains on the way to work. For the first minute of the call, she just giggled. But then she grew quiet and tried to express her thoughts: \u2018I\u2019ve never had so many compliments,\u2019 she said. \u2018All of them were meaningful, but to read from moms, telling me: You deserve this\u2014 you did the right thing.\u2019 I had to wear my sunglasses on the train. Because for so long I\u2019d felt guilty. That maybe I should have worked more. A few months ago I was cleaning a lady\u2019s house, and I asked if I could leave a little early-- because my daughter was coming home from college that day.  But the lady didn\u2019t like that. She thinks maybe I just don\u2019t want to work. And it made me feel so guilty. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m afraid of work. I\u2019ve been working since I was thirteen. But after my daughters were born, I wanted to work less. So I could be there when they came home at 4 PM. I thought it was more important than to make another $20 or $50. Sometimes it hurt us. Sometimes we needed things, and I didn\u2019t have it. But I didn\u2019t want them to be alone. So to read the comments, from other moms, saying: \u2018They needed you there. You did the right thing.\u2019 I needed to read that. And thank you so much to everyone who gave. Now I can have a retirement plan. And most people I know\u2014 my older sisters\u2014 they don\u2019t have these things. They are tired, and sick, but they keep working. And that\u2019s OK. But in a way, it\u2019s not. Because they all have a story like mine. We\u2019ve all been working since we were very young. But I don\u2019t have to do that anymore. I don\u2019t have to work until I can\u2019t. I can take some time. With my daughters especially. They\u2019re not as young anymore, but still, we can do things together. I can take them places. And not just to a park anymore. But to dinner-- and restaurants. I can enjoy, and not feel guilty. So thank you. I\u2019m also going to take time for myself now. I\u2019m going to get my GED. It will be hard, because of the math. Even in sixth grade I hated math. But I\u2019m going to do it. So thank you to everyone. To the people who gave so much. And also to the people who gave just a little, because it grew into something very big for me.\u201d",

            "description": "(2/2) \u201cThe only photo I have from childhood is from my sixth-grade report card. It was the same year my mother told me I had to leave school. I moved to Mexico City and began working as a housekeeper for a rich family. They had a daughter who was the same age as me. And I felt so envious of her. She had her own bedroom. She had so many nice things. She went to the concerts of famous singers. But most importantly, she was going to school. When I was fifteen I came to America. I started working in the home of a young couple. It was near a high school, and it hurt me every morning. Seeing all those teenagers going to school. When my daughters were born, I said: \u2018They\u2019re going to college, no matter what.\u2019 I started reading little books to them every night. My English wasn\u2019t good, but I knew they wouldn\u2019t judge me. But after third grade it became very hard for me to help them. Especially in math. But I kept pushing them. I told them my story. How I\u2019d been all alone in life. How I never had this opportunity\u2014to go to school. I always said to them, in Spanish: \u2018Tu exito es mi exito.\u2019 Your success is my success. I don\u2019t know why they worked so hard. Maybe because we didn\u2019t have anything. Other classmates had their mother, father, car, house. But we had nothing. Just me. There were days I couldn\u2019t pay the $20 for their school trips. I could have taken extra work: more days, more hours. But I wanted to be there when they got home. I wanted to talk to them. To cook them a healthy breakfast in the morning. I wanted them to at least have me. Some of my family members were pushing me to work more. Maybe I seemed lazy to them. For wanting to spend time with my daughters. Back then I didn\u2019t even have the strength to defend myself. But maybe now they see. When my daughters graduated, I wish I could have done more. I put up some decorations at home. But I wish I could have done more, like the other parents. Maybe give them a car. Or take them somewhere nice. I\u2019m not allowed to leave the country, but I\u2019d love to take them somewhere. Maybe Connecticut. Or Pennsylvania. Just a surprise of some sort. Telling them, I\u2019m thankful for them. For giving me this gift. Tu exito es mi exito.\u201d",

            "description": "(1/2) \u201cWe were in a shelter for a few months. My sisters weren\u2019t old enough to remember, but I was five. So I still have memories. But one thing I don\u2019t remember is my mother ever getting emotional. The only time she\u2019d cry is when we were praying in church. We\u2019d all be huddled together, praying for the same thing. It\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever asked of God: for our family to be together again. Dad got deported when I was twelve or thirteen. After that my mom had to start working much more. She took extra housekeeping jobs on the weekend. And I\u2019m still not sure how she did it, because I don\u2019t remember her being absent from important things. She was the one pushing me and my sisters to do more and more. She\u2019d sign us up for music class at the community center. And swimming lessons. She was the one who pushed us to join the debate team. She could never make it to the actual debating, but she\u2019d come in the evening for the awards ceremony. She was at every single parent-teacher meeting. Our teachers would joke: \u2018You don\u2019t have to be here. You know what we\u2019re going to say.\u2019 But I think she just needed to be reassured-- that we were doing great. There was so much she couldn\u2019t give us: concert tickets, new clothes. She at least needed to know that she was being a good mother. I went on to graduate from Wesleyan. My other sister from Yale. And my youngest sister is at Stanford right now. I think when my mom looks at us, she sees her own potential. She left school in sixth grade to work on her family\u2019s farm. She\u2019s low income. Undocumented. For her entire life she\u2019s been so limited. I\u2019m working at a nonprofit right now. And it\u2019s not a ton of money, so I\u2019m still living at home. My mom wakes up earlier than I do. She comes home later. She works harder for less money. And she doesn\u2019t have real health insurance. The other day I was at a staff retreat. We were sitting on a rooftop, drinking wine. And I couldn\u2019t help but think about my mom. She\u2019s never been to a rooftop. There\u2019s a whole other side of this city that she\u2019s never seen. A whole other side of life. It\u2019s a side she would have known if she\u2019d been able to navigate the world. And it\u2019s a side I hope to show her one day.\u201d",

            "description": "After our first meeting Saroj gifted me an antique Bible. She then revealed that most of her own prayers were directed to Durga Maa, the \u2018Goddess of Energy.\u2019 I would later learn that Durga Maa\u2019s cosmic arsenal includes \u2018strength,\u2019 \u2018protection,\u2019 and \u2018motherhood.\u2019 Since I\u2019m a big believer in all those things, Durga Maa definitely seemed like a deity I could get behind. Over the next few weeks she became a thing between me and Saroj. We pasted Durga Maa animations into our text threads. Saroj sent my daughter a Durga Maa birthday card. And whenever we hit a snag in our negotiations with her landlord, it was: \u2018Nothing to worry about. Durga Maa is on the move.\u2019 Right before the fundraiser got posted, Saroj was a nervous wreck. We weren\u2019t sure that we could raise the full amount to settle her debts. But even if we did, it would mean closing an important chapter in her life. Saroj had put her heart and soul into The Dress Shoppe for forty years. It represented community to her. It represented income during her old age. And it also represented her husband\u2019s legacy. Saroj\u2019s breast cancer would no longer allow her to shoulder the stress of a business. Still\u2014it would be extremely hard to let go. \u2018But Durga Maa sent you here,\u2019 she said. \u2018So I will go with her.\u2019 As of this moment the fundraiser is over $430,000. I was too shy to ask everyone for more than the $130,000 needed to cover Saroj\u2019s debts, because it was already such a high amount. I was nervous about us getting there. But Durga Maa knew Saroj needed much more. And Durga Maa moved quite forcefully. I wasn\u2019t in New York when I posted the story, but @newyorknico went and sat with Saroj. When the fundraiser reached $25,000 in only a few minutes, I called to let Saroj know that it was going to be a success. I didn\u2019t realize Nico was filming. But it made me smile when he sent me the video. Especially when I noticed Durga Maa dangling from a chain around Saroj\u2019s neck. Thanks so much to everyone who contributed. And thanks to everyone who stopped by to visit The Dress Shoppe at 83 Second Avenue. Saroj has been sending me selfies all day. If you really squint your eyes, you can see Durga Maa smiling in each one.",

Or a little more jewelry\u2019 And I\u2019d tell him, \u2018Oh Goyal, please shut up.\u2019 But he loved clothes. It was his passion. Every piece of clothing in our store he chose himself. We\u2019ve owned this business for forty years, and the entire time I was his helper. That\u2019s just how things were in our generation. Now young women are working in India, but not during our time. So I\u2019ve always been his helper. I was the shy one. Goyal was the one who approached the customers. Everyone loved him. You should see the things they wrote in his memorial book. Whenever people saw him, they were shining in the face. Because he always had a joke. One hundred jokes per minute. People would pull him on stage at parties, and say: \u2018Please Goyal, make the jokes.\u2019 He even made the nurses laugh at the hospital. During the months he was sick in bed, he still wanted me to dress for him. \u2018Please Saroj,\u2019 he\u2019d say. \u2018Just a little more jewelry.\u2019 He fought for the longest time. I wanted to give him my kidney, but I wasn\u2019t a match. He said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to die, Saroj. I don\u2019t want.\u2019 But on the last day he said: \u2018Krishna is coming to take me.\u2019 That was two years ago. And it\u2019s been so hard for me with him gone. He\u2019d do anything to make me laugh, but he never told me anything. Nothing about the accounting. Or how much we owed. Or the taxes. I still don\u2019t understand the tax thing. I\u2019m a little upset with him. Because he left me in this situation. I had to close down when the pandemic came. And when we opened our doors again, there was nobody: no cars, no nothing. I owe so much money now. I miss him so much. At home I\u2019ve made an altar to him. When I take my bath, first I pray to him. He was everything to me. Everything. But I\u2019m angry, I really am. I wish he\u2019d have told me more. Because without him I can\u2019t deal with this. My two children live far away. And I stay alone. Sometimes I feel like if something happens to me, nobody will know it. I put on a sari for this interview, and some lipstick. But it\u2019s the first time in a long time. Because there\u2019s nobody asking me to dress up anymore.\u201d",

He\u2019d take us to the candy store, or the flea market, or to bumper cars on Coney Island. Then sometimes we\u2019d go home and play \u2018Alaska.\u2019 Alaska was this crazy game we\u2019d play in the middle of the winter. My dad would open up all the windows in his apartment, and we\u2019d pretend we were in Alaska. He was always doing crazy things like that. But we had a very conventional mother and stepfather. So the way we saw it\u2014we had the best of both worlds. Dad never held down a nine-to-five job, so he was always selling something. Or at least looking to make a trade. At restaurants he\u2019d attempt to pay for our meal with jewelry. Or he\u2019d try to talk our cab driver into accepting a bottle of perfume. He\u2019d stop anyone on the street to sell them a scarf, or even just to talk. But his true passion has always been magic. He carries a deck of cards with him everywhere. And he\u2019ll wrangle an audience wherever he can find one. He says: \u2018Accadas, Nitram,\u2019 which is his name backwards. Then he\u2019ll pull a card out of the ear or mouth of anyone walking down the street. He\u2019s extremely good. You can pick a random card, shuffle the deck, and he\u2019ll pretend he can\u2019t find it. Then he\u2019ll pull it out of his wallet. One time he came to my third-grade class in a cape and hat, and did a magic show. I got to be the magician\u2019s assistant, and we made three oranges disappear. The other kids couldn\u2019t believe it. Brandi\u2019s dad did magic! I was star of the day. Star of the year. When I had kids of my own, Pop Pop did a magic show for all of their classes. I insisted on it. Dad is eighty-five now. Maybe the correct card doesn\u2019t always come out of the deck anymore, but he\u2019s still magic. This Father\u2019s Day we took him out to lunch. And as we were leaving the restaurant, I turned around and saw him at a stranger\u2019s table. He was performing a trick for two young children, and they loved it of course. But for me it brought back a flood of memories. Of the thousands of people this man has made smile over the years.\u201d",

            "description": "\u201cThe story of the black cowboy began when our ancestors were brought to this country against their will. Many of them were adept with horses. The first Kentucky Derbies were won by black jockeys. One out of four cowboys in The West were black. But you never see that in the movies. My father was a sharecropper. When I was a young boy he would put me on the back of a horse and direct me where to plow. Eventually I became so skilled that I tried my hand at the rodeo circuit. But I soon learned that a black cowboy could sit on a bull for half a day and still not win any prize money. I ended up getting a doctorate from St. Johns, and over the years I worked at several different universities. But I kept running into colleagues who didn\u2019t believe there was such a thing as a black cowboy. And that wasn\u2019t going to stand. So in 1984 I organized The Black World Championship Rodeo. Nobody thought it could be done. It was the first rodeo ever held in a US urban city. But I got all the permits. I covered all the expenses from my own pocket. We flew in all the best black cowboys from around the country, and we flew them first class. We held our first rodeo in Harlem\u2019s Colonel Young Park. Colonel Charles Young was denied a generalship during World War I because he was black. He rode his horse all the way to Washington DC in protest. The protest wasn\u2019t successful, but sixty years later 20,000 people filled Colonel Young Park for the world\u2019s first Black Championship Rodeo. And that number doesn\u2019t even include the people peering down from the high-rise apartments. The Black World Championship Rodeo came back to Harlem every year for the next thirty years. And it\u2019s gonna do for me what the movies did for John Wayne. It\u2019s going to leave me a legend. We opened every rodeo with the national anthem, and a black cowboy would ride out carrying the American flag. It always made me emotional. Because with all the hurdles that we\u2019ve faced, and still face-- it\u2019s amazing that we still love our country. But I do. Because it afforded me the opportunity to do what I did. And I delivered. I showed the whole world: there have always been black cowboys. And there always will be.\u201d",

And there was a trade embargo with China, so there were no stores selling Chinese goods, even in Chinatown. But I was idealistic. I thought: \u2018Maybe I can help connect our two countries. If I traded with China\u2014just a little, maybe we would understand each other more.\u2019 Technically it was smuggling. But the rules were very gray. And if you gave the Canadian border agent a little tip, nobody seemed to mind. I named the store \u2018Pearl River,\u2019 which is the biggest river in the Canton Province. I wanted to remind Chinese immigrants of their home. And I thought: \u2018Nobody can hate a river.\u2019 We stocked our shelves with products that many immigrants hadn\u2019t seen for twenty years. These were products from their childhood: their favorite soy sauce, their favorite soap, their favorite tea. Word spread quickly in the community. Everything I put on the shelves was gone the next day. It was beginner\u2019s luck. We were in the right place at the right time. This was the early seventies\u2014the time of Vietnam. And American students were becoming anti-war, anti-establishment. I\u2019d drive to the Harvard campus with boxes of Mao jackets and political posters, and all of them would be sold. The FBI interviewed me many times. They thought for sure I was a communist agent. They\u2019d ask me: \u2018Why else start a store like this?\u2019 But I would tell them: \u2018I just want people to learn more about China.\u2019 Art is not the only way to understand other cultures. Business is major too. Maybe customer will pick up some tea off the shelf, and I will explain the history of tea in China. Or maybe customer will pick up this traditional cough medicine called Pei Pa Koa. It was invented hundreds of years ago. And it\u2019s made of roots and loquat\u2014a fruit only found in China. Maybe this will make the customer curious. Maybe they will leave with a question. And they will be inspired to learn more about China. This brings us closer together. And that\u2019s why trade is such a big part of peace. Every product has a story. And every product is a chance for connection.\u201d",

            "description": "\u201cMy best memories from childhood are going to work with him. He\u2019d give me a little vase and let me make my own arrangements. Even though they were terrible, he\u2019d always pretend like he sold them. I loved being part of his world. He\u2019d take me to all the neighboring shops, and everyone knew him. Partly because he\u2019s 6\u20196\u201d. But also because people just love being around my dad. His energy is infectious. He built all of this himself. He never went to high school. Never took a business class. He just loves flowers. He\u2019ll tell anyone who\u2019ll listen: \u2018I love this job. Every day I love this job.\u2019 I guess I just assumed I\u2019d grow up to be the same way. I\u2019ve always been Bill\u2019s daughter. I love to take risks, and connect with people. I thought I\u2019d do something special too. But somewhere along the way I lost myself. I don\u2019t know--why does any woman lose herself? When you\u2019re a mom, and a wife, and a career woman, so much of your day is spent on everyone else. I hadn\u2019t even visited my dad at his shop in over ten years. I\u2019d see him at his house on the weekends, but I always had my kid with me. Or my husband. So I never had a chance to just \u2018be a daughter.\u2019 But last May I was given an assignment in graduate school: I could write a report on any industry, so I chose flowers. Because I knew it would give me an excuse to visit my dad. When I came to the store he was in a tough spot. He\u2019d been forced to change locations because of the pandemic. But he\u2019d made so many friends already. Time after time a person would walk in, and they\u2019d have their own little thing between them. I visited right before Mother\u2019s Day. It was his first in the new spot\u2014so he was trying to decide how many flowers to order. It was very high stakes. He really needed the business, but you\u2019d never know he was under so much pressure. He was having fun. My dad just makes decisions with his heart and worries about the details later. He\u2019s always been that way, and it\u2019s never failed him. On the train home I was lost in my thoughts. It was the best day I\u2019d had in a long time. Being so close to him made me realize something: I was also that way once. And I can be that way again. Because I\u2019ve always been Bill\u2019s daughter.\u201d",

            "description": "\u201cMy dad said we could do something special for my 6th birthday. \u2018Anything you want,\u2019 he told me. I think he thought I was going to say \u2018ice cream.\u2019 But I said I wanted to go to New York City, and two weeks later we were on a plane. We spent the morning of my birthday shopping at the American Girl store. Then we went to lunch at Balthazar. Afterward my dad wanted to stop by an old Irish bar called McSorley\u2019s. He\u2019s not a creepy alcoholic father or anything. He designs bars for a living, and he\u2019s always looking for inspiration. It was early in the afternoon so the bar was pretty calm. My dad ordered a beer, and an old man came and sat down at our table. He looked very Irish: suspenders, loose pants, red face. And he was very, very kind. He showed us a few card tricks. He loved that my last name was O\u2019Brien. He kept calling me a \u2018real life Irish princess.\u2019 At the end of our visit we took a photo together. And as he was leaving, he told me: \u2018I\u2019m Matty Maher. The owner of this bar. And I\u2019ll be expecting to see you again on your 21st birthday.\u2019 As soon as we got home, we mailed Matty the photo of us. My dad and I visited McSorley\u2019s a few more times over the years\u2014 anytime we were in New York. I\u2019d always send Matty a postcard in advance, to let him know we were coming. But after awhile I wasn\u2019t a little kid anymore. The bouncer got less and less excited about letting me inside, so we stopped going. I didn\u2019t see Matty for several years. But when my 21st birthday came around, my dad took me on one last trip to New York. I sent Matty a postcard to let him know we were coming, but I wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d remember me. It was early afternoon when we walked in the bar. It was almost empty\u2014just like it had been fifteen years before. Matty was nowhere to be seen. And I was coming down with strep throat, so I wanted to leave. But it was just like a movie. The doors swung open, and Matty came in like a ray of sunshine. He brought a plate of cupcakes over to our table. He showed me a framed photograph of the two of us\u2014it had been hanging in his office all these years. And then he gave me a birthday card. Inside he had written: \u2018I\u2019ve finally met a woman who keeps her word.\u2019\u201d",
