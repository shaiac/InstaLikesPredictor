            "description": "Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto / In 2015 I took part in the first Greenland Caves Project expedition to northeast Greenland. That original expedition, partly supported by the National Geographic Society, was full of adventure. It involved flying as far as we could in a Twin Otter to a tiny airstrip on a sandy spit of land in the middle of nowhere. We inflated a boat and crossed a 20-kilometer-wide (12-mile-wide) lake, then we hiked for three days to get to some small, seemingly insignificant caves near the top of the world. At the time, we didn\u2019t know it would become a recce expedition that would lead to years of research. Professor Gina Moseley, the project leader, collected samples of cave calcite to use to reconstruct records of past climate change. The pilot data proved highly important and resulted in a prestigious FWF Start prize, enabling the research to continue for the next six years. On July 3, 2019, nine people set off on an interdisciplinary expedition back to 80\u00b0 N.",
